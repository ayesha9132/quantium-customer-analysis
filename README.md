# 🛒 Quantium Customer Analytics Project

This project was completed as part of the **Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program**. It explores customer transaction and purchase behavior data using Python for data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization.

## 📊 Key Objectives

- Clean and merge transactional and customer behavior datasets
- Extract product brand and packet size using regex
- Analyze sales and quantity trends across:
  - Customer types (Premium, Mainstream, Budget)
  - Lifestages (Young Singles/Couples, Retirees, etc.)
  - Product brands and packet sizes
- Visualize trends over time (monthly sales, most popular brands/sizes)

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Regex for feature extraction

## 📁 Files

- `customeranalysis.py`: Complete cleaned Python script for analysis
- Visualizations included in comments for better understanding

## 📌 Insights

- Premium customers generate a significant portion of total sales
- Specific brands and packet sizes are preferred by different life stages
- Sales vary seasonally, with peaks in December
